# Hey, it's a Begin app! ✨


## Getting started
- First, initialize the repo + route deps: `npm i && npx hydrate`
  - Note: as routes are changed, re-run `npx hydrate` as often as you like to update and (re)install all routes' node_modules
- To start a local dev server: `npm start`
- To lint your code: `npm run lint`
- To run your tests: `npm t`
