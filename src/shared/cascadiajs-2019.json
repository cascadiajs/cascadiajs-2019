Web Packaging is a set of proposals that allows web content to be digitally signed and packaged, so that the content can become \"portable\", i.e. it can not only be retrieved from the original publisher’s site, but also via a fast cache, over p2p protocol, via an SD card, or virtually anything you can think of.  We believe this can increase the availability of web content for a wider audience, even where internet connectivity isn’t always available!",
