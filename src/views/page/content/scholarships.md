CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund this year's Scholarship Program.

## Requirements

The Scholarship Program is open to everyone who meets these requirements:

- Able to attend both days of the conference (Nov 7 &amp; Nov 8)
- Resident of the Pacific Northwest
- Member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech -or-
- Have financial constraints that would otherwise prevent you from attending

## How it works

- Apply for a scholarship
- If you meet the requirements above, you will be offered a scholarship ticket for the discounted rate of $99
- If you cannot afford that, that's ok! Please submit your application, and we'll be in touch.

## FAQ

**Does the scholarship include travel and hotel?**

No, but we will collect information on folks who live more than 1-hour outside of Seattle, WA and will fund travel and lodging on a case-by-case basis if our funding supports it.

**Are there additional resources and support for Scholarship Recipients?**

Yes! We plan on hosting an exclusive mixer for Scholars where they will get to meet and network with mentors and leaders in the tech community. We are also in the process of planning more specific programs to assist folks who are looking for jobs, looking for mentors, seeking training, etc. Stay tuned!
