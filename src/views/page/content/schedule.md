We are putting on the finishing touches of the Schedule of Events for the week of CascadiaJS 2019. But for now, here is a rough outline so that you can plan appropriately:

* Nov 4 - [React Workshop](/workshop-reactjs) (9am - 5pm)
* Nov 5 - [GraphQL Workshop](/workshop-graphql) (9am - 5pm)
* Nov 6 - GraphQL Workshop (9am - 5pm)

* Nov 9 - [Kid's Coding](/kids-coding) (9:45am - noon)

There are no _official_ events planned for the weekend following the conference, but we are encouraging folks to self-organize. There's no reason the fun has to end just because the conference is over. Please keep an eye on our [Weekend Fun](https://2019.cascadiajs.com/weekend) webpage and submit a PR if you'd like to plan something fun!

## Social Events

We have finalized the locations and timing of the Opening and Closing Parties for the conference.

### Opening Party at Town Hall Seattle (5pm - 9pm)

The Opening Party will take place at the conference venue, Town Hall Seattle, immediately following the closing remarks of Day One.

The event will be fully catered, so you can look forward to grabbing a bite and hanging out with some of the new friends you've made on Day One in the comfy confines of Town Hall Seattle.

### Closing Party at Optimism Brewing (7pm - 11pm)

The Closing Party will take place at Optimism Brewing, just 10 minutes up the street from Town Hall Seattle. We've baked-in a 2 hour break between the end of the conference and the start of the Closing Party so that you can get dinner with your new friends before spending the night playing games and singing karaoke ðŸŽ¤!

### We're Looking for Sponsors!

We are still looking for sponsors for the Opening and Closing parties! If your company would like to help us create an amazing experience for 500+ JavaScript developers, please reach out and let us know!

## Engineer Coffee Chats

Several of our sponsors (Formidable, AWS, Zulily, DocuSign and others) are actively hiring for open roles. Since there are many questions that you all have that are best answered by a fellow engineer, we are organizing 30-min coffee chats between job seekers and engineers on teams that have open roles.

_These are not job interviewers, they are designed to be casual and provide the job seeker with an opportunity to learn more about the role, the team and the company._

If you plan on signing-up for a coffee chat, please make sure you've created a [Fizbuz developer profile](https://fizbuz.com). You'll need this when you fill-out the form a select the companies you'd like to connect with at the conference.
