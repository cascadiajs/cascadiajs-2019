CascadiaJS is the premier JavaScript conference in the Pacific Northwest and is being held in Seattle, WA on Nov 7-8. This year's event will bring together an amazing group of ~600 web developers from across the Pacific Northwest (and beyond). You will find every kind of developer you can imagine:

* Code newbies all the way to senior executives
* Front-end, back-end and full-stack engineers
* Expertise in popular frameworks (React, Vue, Express), tools (GraphQL, AWS, Socket.io)
* Members of under-represented groups in tech

Over the course of 2 days, you'll hear 20 amazing talks by experts and their fields, covering everything from Web Assembly to HTTP/3 to building more inclusive teams. In between and around these talks we will create lots of opportunities for you to meet people and connect, including scheduling frequent breaks between talks, catering meals at the venue and organizing several social evening social events.

Whether you're looking for a job or just looking to meet folks who share your passion for GatsbyJS, CascadiaJS 2019 will help you grow your network!
