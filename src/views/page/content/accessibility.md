# Accessibility Matters to Us

In order to build an inclusive community for web developers we work hard to make our event as accessible as possible. Below you'll find information on our efforts this year. If there's something you think we're missing, please don't hesitate to contact us! CascadiaJS is for everyone.

## Entering the Venue

A 3-minute drop-off and loading zone exists across the street from the 8th Avenue Entrance. The doors are accessible via a ramp and lead, at-grade, into our lobby level. From there, you can access an at-grade elevator serving all three levels of the building, as well as an all-gender, ADA restroom.

## Restrooms

Town Hall features 18 all-gender restrooms on our lobby level, as well as ADA-accessible restrooms on the lobby and Forum level.

## Hearing Loop

A Hearing Loop system has been installed in all three of performance spaces. These enable audience members with T-coil hearing aids to experience our events at full volume by having sounds from the stageâ€™s microphones transmitted directly to their hearing aids!

## Seating

Anyone can reserve a front-row seat or space for their wheelchair/mobility device.

## Service Animals

Town Hall welcomes certified service animals on all levels of our building. No other animals are permitted. 

## Live Captioning

All host remarks and Main Stage talks will be live-captioned by  [White Coat Captioning](https://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com/).

## Access for Speakers & Staff

Town Hall is also ADA accessible for speakers and staff. All backstage and back-of-house areas are accessible for all bodies.
