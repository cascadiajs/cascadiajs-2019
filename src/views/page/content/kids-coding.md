# Kids Coding

CascadiaJS is staging a JavaScript Takeover at [Seattle CoderDojo](https://www.seattlecoderdojo.com)!

Seattle CoderDojo has been teaching Seattle kids to code (for FREE) for the past six years. CascadiaJS is helping them stage a JavaScript takeover of their free kids event on the Saturday after the conference.

We'll share ticketing links soon, but right now they're hoping some of the amazing JavaScript devs who are attending/speaking at CascadiaJS might want to run a kids' workshop during the Takeover.

* Where: Amazon.com Wainwright in South Lake Union
* When: November 9, 10-noon (instructors should arrive at 9:30)
* Ages: They primarily get 4th-8th graders, but skew older/younger on the edges.
* Levels: From Beginner to Intermediate
* Restrictions: Kids can be on Linux, ChromeOS, MacOS, or Windows, so curriculum should not require installation of software.

If you'd like to teach a workshop, email gregb@seattlecoderdojo.com.

More info coming soon!
