# Kids Coding

### [Free Tickets Here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/seattle-coderdojo-cascadiajs-present-learn-javascript-for-kids-free-tickets-77667963971)

CascadiaJS is staging a JavaScript Takeover at [Seattle CoderDojo](https://www.seattlecoderdojo.com)!

Seattle CoderDojo has been teaching Seattle kids to code (for FREE) for the past six years. CascadiaJS is helping them stage a JavaScript takeover of their free kids event on the Saturday after the conference.

We'll share ticketing links soon, but right now they're hoping some of the amazing JavaScript devs who are attending/speaking at CascadiaJS might want to help teach a planned workshop on Saturday.

* Where: Amazon.com Wainwright in South Lake Union
* When: November 9, 10-noon (instructors should arrive at 9:30)
* Ages: They primarily get 4th-8th graders, but skew older/younger on the edges.
* Planned Workshops:
  * Beginners: WoofJS (helping kids transition from Scratch to JS)
  * Intermediate: Build an endless runner with PhaserJS
  * Advanced: Solve the devilishly hard puzzles in the coding game "Untrusted"

If you'd like to help teach, register for a volunteer ticket and email gregb@seattlecoderdojo.com to let him know you're coming. He'll be helping out with CascadiaJS both days, so you can also catch up with him there.
