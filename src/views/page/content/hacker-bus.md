# Hacker Bus

All aboard the Hacker Bus! If you live in Portland, OR or Vancouver, BC there is **no better way** to get to CascadiaJS than to join your fellow devs on the Hacker Bus. We are chartering buses departing Portland, OR and Vancouver, BC so that you can make some friends and fork repos on the bus Wi-Fi as you head to Seattle. The Hacker Bus will make two stops at our [partner hotels](/hotels).

*NOTE: the Hacker Bus is one way! Make sure you book your return trip*
